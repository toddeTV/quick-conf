# Code of Conduct

QuickConf is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our conference a harassment-free experience for everyone. We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Expected Behavior

All conference participants are expected to:

- **Be respectful** - Value each other's ideas, styles, and viewpoints
- **Be direct but professional** - We must be able to speak directly when we disagree, but we must do so professionally and respectfully
- **Be inclusive** - Seek diverse perspectives and make newcomers feel welcome
- **Understand different perspectives** - Our goal should not be to "win" every disagreement, but to learn from each other
- **Appreciate and accommodate our similarities and differences** - We come from many cultures and backgrounds
- **Lead by example** - By matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable:

- Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language
- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material
- Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability
- Inappropriate photography or recording
- Inappropriate physical contact without consent
- Unwelcome sexual attention, including sexualized comments or jokes
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a conference organizer as soon as possible.

### How to Report

- Your account of what occurred
- Any additional context or information

## Consequences

Unacceptable behavior from any conference participant, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including:

- Warning the offender
- Expulsion from the conference without refund
- Banning from future events
- Reporting to local law enforcement
